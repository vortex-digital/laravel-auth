# Laravel Simple Auth Installer

Simple authentication scaffolding like it was before Jetstream and Fortify, and automatically works with the latest laravel releases ðŸ”¥

## Documentation

First, download the Laravel installer using Composer:

```
composer global require vortex-digital/laravel-simple-auth-installer
```

Once installed, the laravel-simple new command will create a fresh Laravel installation with most loved authentication scaffolding in the directory you specify. 

```
laravel-simple new foo

laravel-simple new foo --auth

laravel-simple new foo --vue-auth

laravel-simple new foo --react-auth
```

You can also install with [Laravel Jetstream](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream) as well.
